Nestled in the northwest corner of Powhatan County, Virginia, you will find a friendly, welcoming congregation. 

We are sinners who are counted as saints by the wonderful grace of our God.

We draw near to our God and Savior:

- through the Scriptures, 
- through our gathering together in worship, in ministry, in fellowship with one another, and 
- through sharing Him with one another and with others.

Our doors are open to people from all backgrounds who desire to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The atmosphere is relaxed and guests are never pressured or embarrassed.

As a church that lives under the cross, this is a biblical place to grow in your faith. It is a safe place to be accepted before God and man. It is a warm place to raise a family. This is a good place to call home.

## Beliefs

We are theologically conservative with an emphasis on expository, biblical preaching & teaching. In a nutshell, we hold to the five banners of the reformation faith. A person is:

- Justified before God by the grace of God alone;
- Through faith alone;
- Because of Christ alone;
- According to the Scriptures alone;
- For the glory of God alone.

We hold to the 1853 New Hampshire Confession which can be read [here](http://www.reformedreader.org/ccc/1833newh.htm) if you would like more details.
