_Nestled in the northwest corner of Powhatan County, Virginia, you will find a friendly, welcoming congregation. We are sinners who are counted as saints by the wonderful grace of our God. We draw near to our God and Savior through the Scriptures, through our gathering together in worship, in ministry, in fellowship with one another, and through sharing Him with one another and with others._

_Our doors are open to people from all denominations who desire to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. The atmosphere is relaxed and guests are never pressured or embarrassed. As a church that lives under the cross, this is a biblical place to grow in your faith. It is a safe place to be accepted before God and man. It is a warm place to raise a family. This is a good place to call home._
