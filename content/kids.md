At Muddy Creek we believe that families are important and that discipleship starts at home.

We provide opportunities for families to grow together though:

- A small group for families with children at 10:00 with child care, and
- Children's classes durring the 11:00 service.

This two prongged appraoch means that parents can grow together, and find fellowship and friends but also allows children to have time growing and having fun with their peers. 

_We care deeply about the health ands saftey of our children. To that end, regular volunteers have back groud checks and classes are help in places where they can be observed easily by people passing by._
