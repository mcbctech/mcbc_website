      <description>At Muddy Creek we believe that families are important and that discipleship starts at home.
We provide opportunities for families to grow together though:
A small group for families with children at 10:00 AM with child care, and During the 11:00 service there is: Nursery for babies A toddler class for ages 2-3 A preschool and Elementary class for ages 4 trough 5th grade. This two prongged appraoch allows parents can grow together and build friendships while children have time growing and having fun with their peers.</description>

Muddy Creek seems to meet these needs in two ways:
