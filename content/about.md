**Nestled in the northwest corner of Powhatan County, Virginia, you will find a friendly, welcoming congregation.** 

We are a church with an emphasis on teaching Godâ€™s Word, along with building relationships, prayer, and sincere love. Living this out day-to-day in the Gospel of Grace is our journey together.

**Meet our [Leaders](#leaders) | Find out about our [Beliefs](#beliefs)** 


We draw near to our God and Savior:

- through the Scriptures, 
- through our gathering together in worship, in ministry, in fellowship with one another, and 
- through sharing Him with one another and with others.

**Our doors are open to people from all backgrounds who desire to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.**

We strive for our guests to feel relaxed and welcomed. You won't be put on the spot.

As a church that lives under the cross, this is a biblical place to grow in your faith. It is a safe place to be accepted before God and man. It is a warm place to raise a family. This is a good place to call home.

# Beliefs

We are theologically conservative with an emphasis on expository, biblical preaching & teaching. In a nutshell, we hold to the five banners of the reformation faith. A person is:

- Justified and made right with God by the grace of God alone;
- Through faith alone;
- Because of Christ alone;
- According to the Scriptures alone;
- For the glory of God alone.
<!-- TODO make video explainer-->
We hold to the 1853 New Hampshire Confession. You can read it [here](http://www.reformedreader.org/ccc/1833newh.htm) if you would like more details.
