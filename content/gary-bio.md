He has served in various churches as choir director, orchestra director, deacon, and Sunday School teacher. Along with his wife, Bula, they have served together as a musical team serving in both schools and church music. Faith and family are seen in their joy of being with their nine grandchildren and great grandchildren.

Gary’s passion is in personal Bible study and helping others find the treasure of God’s Word. His hobbies include hunting, fishing, but mostly working on his model toy train layout, which is a sight to see.
