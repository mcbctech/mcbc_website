      <description>At Muddy Creek we believe that families are important and that discipleship starts at home.
We provide opportunities for families to grow together though:
A small group for families with children at 10:00 AM with child care, and Children&amp;rsquo;s classes during the 11:00 service. This two prongged appraoch allows parents can grow together and build friendships while children have time growing and having fun with their peers.
We care deeply about the health and saftey of our children.</description>
