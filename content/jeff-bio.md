After a brief career in radio broadcasting, Jeff attended a Bible school where he met Lisa. They got married in 1985 and soon began a life in ministry. Jeff and Lisa have two children and two grandchildren. Family is a central part of their daily lives.

Jeff has been a pastor for over 30 years. He’s served churches in Tennessee, North Carolina, California, and Virginia. Most of this time he was bi-vocational. 

**He became the pastor of Muddy Creek Baptist in 2014 while also working for the Virginia Medicaid agency. He retired from Medicaid in 2022 and began serving as the pastor full-time.**

When he is not spending time with his wife and family, he enjoys his Old English Sheepdog, Watson, kayaking, and spending time with friends. Writing is a passion that Jeff  uses in ministry to the church, and he has published two novels: 

- _The Place of Prayer_, and 
- _A Reason to Pray at Mountainview_. 

Jeff has a Master of Arts in Religion, from California Graduate School of Theology (CGST), and a Master of Business Administration, from Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business (VCU).

The biggest theological influence is the old English Puritans, especially pastors:

 - Thomas Brooks, and 
- John Bunyan. 

Other strong influences include: 

- Charles H. Spurgeon, 
- Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, and 
- Ligonier Ministries.
