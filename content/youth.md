Youth are an important part of the church. They need their own opportunities to grow faith and get input from mentors as they navigate the changes and challenges they face as they're moving toward adulthood. 

Muddy Creek seems to meet these needs in two ways:

- Sunday morning class with Pastor [Jeff](/mcbc_website/jeff-bio) at 10am
- Wednesday night youth group 6:30-8:00pm
