At Muddy Creek we believe that families are important and that discipleship starts at home.

We provide opportunities for families to grow together though:

- A small group for families with children at 10:00 AM with child care, and
- Children's classes during the 11:00 service.

**This two prongged appraoch allows parents can grow together and build friendships while children have time growing and having fun with their peers.** 

_We care deeply about the health and saftey of our children. Regular volunteers have backgroud checks and classes are in places where they can be observed._
